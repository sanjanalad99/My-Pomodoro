# Pomodoro Timer

## Introduction

Welcome to the Pomodoro Timer repository! This project is a web-based Pomodoro timer designed to boost productivity and focus using the Pomodoro Technique. This repository serves as a demonstration of my learning and enhancement of coding skills through a tutorial.

## Tutorial Source

This project is based on a tutorial provided by [freshman.tech](https://freshman.tech/pomodoro-timer/). The tutorial offered valuable insights into building a Pomodoro Timer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By following along, I gained hands-on experience in structuring a web project, styling it for user appeal, and implementing interactive functionality.

## Learning Highlights

- **HTML Structure:** Improved my understanding of creating a clear and effective HTML structure for a web application.
- **CSS Styling:** Enhanced my styling skills to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly design.
- **JavaScript Functionality:** Strengthened my knowledge of JavaScript, particularly in implementing timer logic and handling user interactions.

## Features

- **Pomodoro Technique:** Leverage the power of the Pomodoro Technique to enhance your work sessions and maintain productivity.
- **Customizable Durations:** Set your preferred work and break durations to tailor the timer to your personal workflow.
- **Audio Notifications:** Receive audible cues for the start and end of each session to stay on track without constantly checking the timer.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Set your desired work and break durations.
4. Click the "Start" button to initiate the Pomodoro timer.
5. Focus during the work session, and take a break during the break session.
6. Repeat the process to complete multiple Pomodoro cycles.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The structure of the timer interface.
- **CSS:** Styling for an appealing and user-friendly design.
- **JavaScript:** Functionality for the timer and user interactions.
